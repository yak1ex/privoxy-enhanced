      On POSIX-like platforms, network sockets with file descriptor
      values above FD_SETSIZE are properly rejected. Previously they
      could cause memory corruption in configurations that allowed
      the limit to be reached.

      Proxy authentication headers are removed unless the new directive
      enable-proxy-authentication-forwarding is used. Forwarding the
      headers potentionally allows malicious sites to trick the user
      into providing them with login information.

     <para>
      Client sockets are now properly shutdown and drained before being
      closed. This fixes page truncation issues with clients that aggressively
      pipeline data on platforms that otherwise discard already written data.
      The issue mainly affected Opera users and was initially reported
      by Kevin in #3464439, szotsaki provided additional information to track
      down the cause.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix latency calculation for shared connections (disabled by default).
      It was broken since their introduction in 2009. The calculated latency
      for most connections would be 0 in which case the timeout detection
      failed to account for the real latency.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Reject URLs with invalid port. Previously they were parsed incorrectly and
      characters between the port number and the first slash were silently
      dropped as shown by curl test 187.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The default-server-timeout and socket-timeout directives accept 0 as
      valid value.

     <para>
      Fix a race condition on Windows that could cause Privoxy to become
      unresponsive after toggling it on or off through the taskbar icon.
      Reported by Tim H. in #3525694.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Fix the compilation on Windows when configured without IPv6 support.

     <para>
      Fix an assertion that could cause debug builds to abort() in case of
      socks5 connection failures with "debug 2" enabled.
     </para>

    General improvements:

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Significantly improved keep-alive support for both client and server
      connections.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      New debug log level 65536 which logs all actions that were applied to
      the request.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      New directive client-header-order to forward client headers in a
      different order than the one in which they arrived.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      New directive tolerate-pipelining to allow client-side pipelining.
      If enabled (3.0.20 beta enables it by default), Privoxy will keep
      pipelined client requests around to deal with them once the current
      request has been served.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      New --config-test option to let Privoxy exit after checking whether or not
      the configuration seems valid. The limitations noted in TODO #22 and #23
      still apply. Based on a patch by Ramkumar Chinchani.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      New limit-cookie-lifetime{} action to let cookies expire before the end
      of the session. Suggested by Rick Sykes in #1049575.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Increase the hard-coded maximum number of actions and filter files from
      10 to 30 (each). It doesn't significantly affect Privoxy's memory usage
      and recompiling wasn't an option for all Privoxy users that reached the
      limit.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Add support for chunk-encoded client request bodies. Previously
      chunk-encoded request bodies weren't guaranteed to be forwarded correctly,
      so this can also be considered a bug fix although chunk-encoded request
      bodies aren't commonly used in the real world.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Add support for Tor's optimistic-data SOCKS extension, which can reduce the
      latency for requests on newly created connections. Currently only the
      headers are sent optimistically and only if the client request has already
      been read completely which rules out requests with large bodies.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      After preventing the client from pipelining, don't signal keep-alive
      intentions. When looking at the response headers alone, it previously
      wasn't obvious from the client's perspective that no additional responses
      should be expected.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Stop considering client sockets tainted after receiving a request with body.
      It hasn't been necessary for a while now and unnecessarily causes test
      failures when using curl's test suite.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Allow HTTP/1.0 clients to signal interest in keep-alive through the
      Proxy-Connection header. While such client are rare in the real world, it
      doesn't hurt and couple of curl tests rely on it.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Only remove duplicated Content-Type headers when filters are enabled.
      If they are not it doesn't cause ill effects and the user might not want it.
      Downgrade the removal message to LOG_LEVEL_HEADER to clarify that it's not
      an error in Privoxy and is unlikely to cause any problems in general.
      Anonymously reported in #3599335.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Set the socket option SO_LINGER for the client socket.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Move several variable declarations to the beginning of their code block.
      It's required when compiling with gcc 2.95 which is still used on some
      platforms. Initial patch submitted by Simon South in #3564815.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Optionally try to sanity-check strptime() results before trusting them.
      Broken strptime() implementations have caused problems in the past and
      the most recent offender seems to be FreeBSD's libc (standards/173421).
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      When filtering is enabled, let Range headers pass if the range starts at
      the beginning. This should work around (or at least reduce) the video
      playback issues with various Apple clients as reported by Duc in #3426305.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Do not confuse a client hanging up with a connection time out. If a client
      closes its side of the connection without sending a request line, do not
      send the CLIENT_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_RESPONSE, but report the condition
      properly.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>

      Allow closing curly braces as part of action values as long as they are

      On Windows, the logfile is now written before showing the GUI error
      message which blocks until the user acknowledges it.

     </para>

     <para>
      Remove an unreasonable parameter limit in the CGI interface. The new
      parameter limit depends on the memory available and is currently unlikely
      to be reachable, due to other limits in both Privoxy and common clients.
      Reported by Andrew on ijbswa-users@.
     </para>
