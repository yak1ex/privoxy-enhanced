 *
 * Revisions   :
 *    $Log: parsers.h,v $
 *    Revision 1.40  2007/08/11 14:47:26  fabiankeil
 *    Remove the prototypes for functions that are only
 *    used in parsers.c and thus should be static.
 *
 *    Revision 1.39  2007/06/01 16:31:55  fabiankeil
 *    Change sed() to return a jb_err in preparation for forward-override{}.
 *
 *    Revision 1.38  2007/03/25 14:27:11  fabiankeil
 *    Let parse_header_time() return a jb_err code
 *    instead of a pointer that can only be used to
 *    check for NULL anyway.
 *
 *    Revision 1.37  2007/03/20 15:22:17  fabiankeil
 *    - Remove filter_client_header() and filter_client_header(),
 *      filter_header() now checks the shiny new
 *      CSP_FLAG_CLIENT_HEADER_PARSING_DONE flag instead.
 *
 *    Revision 1.36  2007/03/05 13:25:32  fabiankeil
 *    - Cosmetical changes for LOG_LEVEL_RE_FILTER messages.
 *    - Handle "Cookie:" and "Connection:" headers a bit smarter
 *      (don't crunch them just to recreate them later on).
 *    - Add another non-standard time format for the cookie
 *      expiration date detection.
 *    - Fix a valgrind warning.
 *
 *    Revision 1.35  2007/01/01 19:36:37  fabiankeil
 *    Integrate a modified version of Wil Mahan's
 *    zlib patch (PR #895531).
 *
 *    Revision 1.34  2006/12/29 19:08:22  fabiankeil
 *    Reverted parts of my last commit
 *    to keep error handling working.
 *
 *    Revision 1.33  2006/12/29 18:04:40  fabiankeil
 *    Fixed gcc43 conversion warnings.
 *
 *    Revision 1.32  2006/12/06 19:14:23  fabiankeil
 *    Added prototype for get_destination_from_headers().
 *
 *    Revision 1.31  2006/08/17 17:15:10  fabiankeil
 *    - Back to timegm() using GnuPG's replacement if necessary.
 *      Using mktime() and localtime() could add a on hour offset if
 *      the randomize factor was big enough to lead to a summer/wintertime
 *      switch.
 *
 *    - Removed now-useless Privoxy 3.0.3 compatibility glue.
 *
 *    - Moved randomization code into pick_from_range().
 *
 *    - Changed parse_header_time definition.
 *      time_t isn't guaranteed to be signed and
 *      if it isn't, -1 isn't available as error code.
 *      Changed some variable types in client_if_modified_since()
 *      because of the same reason.
 *
 *    Revision 1.30  2006/08/14 08:25:19  fabiankeil
 *    Split filter-headers{} into filter-client-headers{}
 *    and filter-server-headers{}.
 *    Added parse_header_time() to share some code.
 *    Replaced timegm() with mktime().
 *
 *    Revision 1.29  2006/08/03 02:46:41  david__schmidt
 *    Incorporate Fabian Keil's patch work:http://www.fabiankeil.de/sourcecode/privoxy/
 *
 *    Revision 1.28  2006/07/18 14:48:47  david__schmidt
 *    Reorganizing the repository: swapping out what was HEAD (the old 3.1 branch)
 *    with what was really the latest development (the v_3_0_branch branch)
 *
 *    Revision 1.26.2.1  2002/09/25 14:52:46  oes
 *    Added basic support for OPTIONS and TRACE HTTP methods:
 *     - New parser function client_max_forwards which decrements
 *       the Max-Forwards HTTP header field of OPTIONS and TRACE
 *       requests by one before forwarding
 *     - New parser function client_host which extracts the host
 *       and port information from the HTTP header field if the
 *       request URI was not absolute
 *     - Don't crumble and re-add the Host: header, but only generate
 *       and append if missing
 *
 *    Revision 1.26  2002/05/08 15:59:53  oes
 *    Changed add_to_iob signature (now returns jb_err)
 *
 *    Revision 1.25  2002/03/26 22:29:55  swa
 *    we have a new homepage!
 *
 *    Revision 1.24  2002/03/24 13:25:43  swa
 *    name change related issues
 *
 *    Revision 1.23  2002/03/13 00:27:05  jongfoster
 *    Killing warnings
 *
 *    Revision 1.22  2002/03/09 20:03:52  jongfoster
 *    - Making various functions return int rather than size_t.
 *      (Undoing a recent change).  Since size_t is unsigned on
 *      Windows, functions like read_socket that return -1 on
 *      error cannot return a size_t.
 *
 *      THIS WAS A MAJOR BUG - it caused frequent, unpredictable
 *      crashes, and also frequently caused JB to jump to 100%
 *      CPU and stay there.  (Because it thought it had just
 *      read ((unsigned)-1) == 4Gb of data...)
 *
 *    - The signature of write_socket has changed, it now simply
 *      returns success=0/failure=nonzero.
 *
 *    - Trying to get rid of a few warnings --with-debug on
 *      Windows, I've introduced a new type "jb_socket".  This is
 *      used for the socket file descriptors.  On Windows, this
 *      is SOCKET (a typedef for unsigned).  Everywhere else, it's
 *      an int.  The error value can't be -1 any more, so it's
 *      now JB_INVALID_SOCKET (which is -1 on UNIX, and in
 *      Windows it maps to the #define INVALID_SOCKET.)
 *
 *    - The signature of bind_port has changed.
 *
 *    Revision 1.21  2002/03/07 03:46:17  oes
 *    Fixed compiler warnings
 *
 *    Revision 1.20  2002/02/20 23:15:13  jongfoster
 *    Parsing functions now handle out-of-memory gracefully by returning
 *    an error code.
 *
 *    Revision 1.19  2002/01/17 21:03:47  jongfoster
 *    Moving all our URL and URL pattern parsing code to urlmatch.c.
 *
 *    Revision 1.18  2001/10/26 17:40:23  oes
 *    Introduced get_header_value()
 *    Removed client_accept()
 *
 *    Revision 1.17  2001/10/13 12:47:32  joergs
 *    Removed client_host, added client_host_adder
 *
 *    Revision 1.16  2001/10/07 18:50:16  oes
 *    Added server_content_encoding, renamed server_transfer_encoding
 *
 *    Revision 1.15  2001/10/07 18:01:55  oes
 *    Changed server_http11 to server_http
 *
 *    Revision 1.14  2001/10/07 15:45:48  oes
 *    added client_accept_encoding, client_te, client_accept_encoding_adder
 *
 *    renamed content_type and content_length
 *
 *    fixed client_host and strclean prototypes
 *
 *    Revision 1.13  2001/09/29 12:56:03  joergs
 *    IJB now changes HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0 in requests and answers.
 *
 *    Revision 1.12  2001/09/13 23:05:50  jongfoster
 *    Changing the string paramater to the header parsers a "const".
 *
 *    Revision 1.11  2001/07/31 14:46:53  oes
 *    Added prototype for connection_close_adder
 *
 *    Revision 1.10  2001/07/30 22:08:36  jongfoster
 *    Tidying up #defines:
 *    - All feature #defines are now of the form FEATURE_xxx
 *    - Permanently turned off WIN_GUI_EDIT
 *    - Permanently turned on WEBDAV and SPLIT_PROXY_ARGS
 *
 *    Revision 1.9  2001/07/29 18:43:08  jongfoster
 *    Changing #ifdef _FILENAME_H to FILENAME_H_INCLUDED, to conform to
 *    ANSI C rules.
 *
 *    Revision 1.8  2001/07/13 14:01:54  oes
 *    Removed all #ifdef PCRS
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2001/06/29 13:32:14  oes

 *    Removed list code - it's now in list.[ch]
 *    Renamed "permission" to "action", and changed many features
 *    to use the actions file rather than the global config.
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/05/27 13:19:06  oes
 *    Patched Joergs solution for the content-length in.
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/05/26 13:39:32  jongfoster
 *    Only crunches Content-Length header if applying RE filtering.
 *    Without this fix, Microsoft Windows Update wouldn't work.
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/20 01:21:20  jongfoster
 *    Version 2.9.4 checkin.
 *    - Merged popupfile and cookiefile, and added control over PCRS
 *      filtering, in new "permissionsfile".
 *    - Implemented LOG_LEVEL_FATAL, so that if there is a configuration
 *      file error you now get a message box (in the Win32 GUI) rather
 *      than the program exiting with no explanation.
 *    - Made killpopup use the PCRS MIME-type checking and HTTP-header
 *      skipping.
 *    - Removed tabs from "config"
 *    - Moved duplicated url parsing code in "loaders.c" to a new funcition.
 *    - Bumped up version number.
 *
 *    Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/15 13:59:01  oes
