><P

>
 and
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="actions-file.html#SERVER-HEADER-TAGGER"
>server-header-tagger</A

>.
 Taggers and filters use the same syntax in the filter files, the difference
 is that taggers don't modify the text they are filtering, but use a rewritten
 version of the filtered text as tag. The tags can then be used to change the
 applying actions through sections with <A
HREF="actions-file.html#TAG-PATTERN"
>tag-patterns</A
>.</P
><P
> Multiple filter files can be defined through the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
> <A
HREF="config.html#FILTERFILE"
>filterfile</A
></TT
> config directive. The filters
 as supplied by the developers are located in
 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>default.filter</TT
>. It is recommended that any locally
 defined or modified filters go in a separately defined file such as
 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>user.filter</TT
>.
 </P
><P
> Common tasks for content filters are to eliminate common annoyances in
 HTML and JavaScript, such as pop-up windows,
 exit consoles, crippled windows without navigation tools, the
 infamous &#60;BLINK&#62; tag etc, to suppress images with certain
 width and height attributes (standard banner sizes or web-bugs),
 or just to have fun.</P
><P
> Enabled content filters are applied to any content whose
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Content Type"</SPAN
> header is recognised as a sign
 of text-based content, with the exception of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>text/plain</TT
>.
 Use the <A
HREF="actions-file.html#FORCE-TEXT-MODE"
>force-text-mode</A
> action
 to also filter other content.</P
><P
> Substitutions are made at the source level, so if you want to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"roll
 your own"</SPAN
> filters, you should first be familiar with HTML syntax, 
 and, of course, regular expressions.</P
><P
> Just like the <A
HREF="actions-file.html"
>actions files</A
>, the
 filter file is organized in sections, which are called <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>filters</I

>
 here. Each filter consists of a heading line, that starts with one of the
 <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>keywords</I
></SPAN
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FILTER:</TT
>,
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

>SERVER-HEADER-FILTER:</TT

 followed by the filter's <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>name</I
></SPAN
>, and a short (one line) 
 <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>description</I
></SPAN
> of what it does. Below that line
 come the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>jobs</I
></SPAN
>, i.e. lines that define the actual
 text substitutions. By convention, the name of a filter
 should describe what the filter <SPAN

>eliminates</I
></SPAN
>. The
 comment is used in the <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/"

>web-based
 user interface</A
>.</P
><P
> Once a filter called <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I

> has been defined
 in the filter file, it can be invoked by using an action of the form
 +<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><A

>.</P
><P
> Filter definitions start with a header line that contains the filter
 type, the filter name and the filter description.
 A content filter header line for a filter called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 like this:</P

 in a syntax that imitates <A

 will find this to be quite intuitive, and may want to look at the
 PCRS documentation for the subtle differences to Perl behaviour. Most
 notably, the non-standard option letter <TT

>U</TT

 which turns the default to ungreedy matching.</P

> Following the header line and a comment, you see the job. Note that it uses

>/</TT
>, because
 the pattern contains a forward slash, which would otherwise have to be escaped
 by a backslash (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\</TT
>).</P
><P
> Now, let's examine the pattern: it starts with the text <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&#60;script.*</TT
>
 enclosed in parentheses. Since the dot matches any character, and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*</TT
>
 means: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Match an arbitrary number of the element left of myself"</SPAN
>, this
 matches <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;script"</SPAN
>, followed by <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>any</I
></SPAN
> text, i.e.
 it matches the whole page, from the start of the first &#60;script&#62; tag.</P
><P
> That's more than we want, but the pattern continues: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>document\.referrer</TT
>
 matches only the exact string <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>. The dot needed to
 be <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>escaped</I
></SPAN
>, i.e. preceded by a backslash, to take away its
 special meaning as a joker, and make it just a regular dot. So far, the meaning is:
 Match from the start of the first &#60;script&#62; tag in a the page, up to, and including,
 the text <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>, if <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>both</I
></SPAN
> are present
 in the page (and appear in that order).</P
><P
> But there's still more pattern to go. The next element, again enclosed in parentheses,
 is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*&#60;/script&#62;</TT
>. You already know what <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</TT
>
 means, so the whole pattern translates to: Match from the start of the first  &#60;script&#62;
 tag in a page to the end of the last &#60;script&#62; tag, provided that the text
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> appears somewhere in between.</P
><P
> This is still not the whole story, since we have ignored the options and the parentheses:
 The portions of the page matched by sub-patterns that are enclosed in parentheses, will be
 remembered and be available through the variables <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1, $2, ...</TT
> in
 the substitute. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>U</TT
> option switches to ungreedy matching, which means
 that the first <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</TT
> in the pattern will only <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"eat up"</SPAN
> all
 text in between <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;script"</SPAN
> and the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>first</I
></SPAN
> occurrence
 of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>, and that the second <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*</TT
> will
 only span the text up to the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>first</I
></SPAN
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"&#60;/script&#62;"</SPAN
>
 tag. Furthermore, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>s</TT
> option says that the match may span
 multiple lines in the page, and the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>g</TT
> option again means that the
 substitution is global.</P
><P
> So, to summarize, the pattern means: Match all scripts that contain the text
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>. Remember the parts of the script from
 (and including) the start tag up to (and excluding) the string
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</TT
>, and the part following
 that string, up to and including the closing tag, as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$2</TT
>.</P
><P
> Now the pattern is deciphered, but wasn't this about substituting things? So
 lets look at the substitute: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1"Not Your Business!"$2</TT
> is
 easy to read: The text remembered as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</TT
>, followed by 
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your Business!"</TT
> (<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>including</I
></SPAN
>
 the quotation marks!), followed by the text remembered as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$2</TT
>.
 This produces an exact copy of the original string, with the middle part
 (the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
>) replaced by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your
 Business!"</TT
>.</P
><P
> The whole job now reads: Replace <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"document.referrer"</SPAN
> by
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"Not Your Business!"</TT
> wherever it appears inside a
 &#60;script&#62; tag. Note that this job won't break JavaScript syntax,
 since both the original and the replacement are syntactically valid
 string objects. The script just won't have access to the referrer
 information anymore.</P
><P
> We'll show you two other jobs from the JavaScript taming department, but
 this time only point out the constructs of special interest:</P
><P

><P
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

 carriage return, form feed), so that <TT

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"zero
 or more whitespace"</SPAN
>. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>?</TT
> in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.*?</TT
>
 makes this matching of arbitrary text ungreedy. (Note that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>U</TT
>
 option is not set). The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>['"]</TT
> construct means: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a single
 <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>or</I
></SPAN
> a double quote"</SPAN
>. Finally, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\1</TT
> is
 a back-reference to the first parenthesis just like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$1</TT
> above,
 with the difference that in the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pattern</I
></SPAN
>, a backslash indicates
 a back-reference, whereas in the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>substitute</I
></SPAN
>, it's the dollar.</P
><P
> So what does this job do? It replaces assignments of single- or double-quoted
 strings to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"window.status"</SPAN
> object with a dummy assignment
 (using a variable name that is hopefully odd enough not to conflict with
 real variables in scripts). Thus, it catches many cases where e.g. pointless
 descriptions are displayed in the status bar instead of the link target when
 you move your mouse over links.</P
