# Purpose     :  Template that is included from most of Privoxy's CGI pages
#                to show the user how to get help or report problems.

#    Revision 1.11  2008/01/02 18:06:58  fabiankeil
#    Instead of linking to the "Contacting the developers ..." section
#    in the FAQ, use the one from the User Manual. The latter can be
#    delivered by Privoxy and thus possibly loads faster.
#
#    Revision 1.10  2007/03/17 11:31:36  fabiankeil
#    - Add revision log and copyright header.
#    - Reword instructions and link to the FAQ
#      in an attempt to reduce the number of
#      incomplete reports.
