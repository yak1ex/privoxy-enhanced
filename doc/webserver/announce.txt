                 Announcing Privoxy v.3.0.11
-----------------------------------------------------------------

3.0.11 is a stable release which includes many enhancements but no major 
new features. The most prominent new feature is "keep-alive" support for 
outgoing connections.

See http://www.privoxy.org/3.0.11/user-manual/whatsnew.html for details.

ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Version 3.0.11 ***
	
- On most platforms, outgoing connections can be kept alive and
  reused if the server supports it. Whether or not this improves
  things depends on the connection.
- When dropping privileges, membership in supplementary groups
  is given up as well. Not doing that can lead to Privoxy running
  with more rights than necessary and violates the principle of
  least privilege. Users of the --user option are advised to update.
  Thanks to Matthias Drochner for reporting the problem,
  providing the initial patch and testing the final version.
- Passing invalid users or groups with the --user option
  didn't lead to program exit. Regression introduced in 3.0.7.
- The match all section has been moved from default.action
  to a new file called match-all.action. As a result the
  default.action no longer needs to be touched by the user
  and can be safely overwritten by updates.
- The standard.action file has been removed. Its content
  is now part of the default.action file.
- In some situations the logged content length was slightly too low.
- Crunched requests are logged with their own log level.
  If you used "debug 1" in the past, you'll probably want
  to additionally enable "debug 1024", otherwise only passed
  requests will be logged. If you only care about crunched
  requests, simply replace "debug 1" with "debug 1024".
- The crunch reason has been moved to the beginning of the
  crunch message. For HTTP URLs, the protocol is logged as well.
- Log messages are shortened by printing the thread id on its
  own (as opposed to putting it inside the string "Privoxy()").
- The config option socket-timeout has been added to control
  the time Privoxy waits for data to arrive on a socket.
- Support for remote toggling is controlled by the configure
  option --disable-toggle only. In previous versions it also
  depended on the action editor and thus configuring with the
  --disable-editor option would disable remote toggling support
  as well.
- Requests with invalid HTTP versions are rejected.
- The template symbol @date@ can be used to include a date(1)-like
  time string. Initial patch submitted by Endre Szabo.
- Responses from shoutcast servers are accepted again.
  Problem reported and fix suggested by Stefan.
- The hide-forwarded-for-headers action has been replaced with
  the change-x-forwarded-for{} action which can also be used to
  add X-Forwarded-For headers. The latter functionality already
  existed in Privoxy versions prior to 3.0.7 but has been removed
  as it was often used unintentionally (by not using the
  hide-forwarded-for-headers action).
- A "clear log" view option was added to the mingw32 version
  to clear out all of the lines in the Privoxy log window.
  Based on a patch submitted by T Ford.
- The mingw32 version uses "critical sections" now, which prevents
  log message corruption under load. As a side effect, the
  "no thread-safe PRNG" warning could be removed as well.
- The mingw32 version's task bar icon is crossed out and
  the color changed to gray if Privoxy is toggled off.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering
capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data,
managing HTTP cookies, controlling access, and removing ads,
banners, pop-ups and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy
has a flexible configuration and can be customized to suit
individual needs and tastes. Privoxy has application for
both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.

Privoxy is based on Internet Junkbuster (tm).

At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000,
XP, Vista), Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and
others), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and
various other flavors of Unix.

In addition to the core features of ad blocking and cookie management,
Privoxy provides many supplemental features, that give the end-user
more control, more privacy and more freedom:


    *  Can keep outgoing connections alive and reuse them later on.

    *  Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client
       and server headers.

    *  Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
       configure browsers individually.

    *  Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and
       client headers.

    *  Can be chained with other proxies.

    *  Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at
       http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
       tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.

    *  Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size,
       invisible "web-bugs", JavaScript and HTML annoyances, pop-up windows,
       etc.)

    *  Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user
       settings to reside in separate files, so that installing updated actions
       files won't overwrite individual user settings.

    *  Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration
       files, and a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax.

    *  Improved cookie management features (e.g. session based cookies).

    *  GIF de-animation.

    *  Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).

    *  Multi-threaded (POSIX and native threads).

    *  User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g.
       "blocked" page).

    *  Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.

    *  Improved signal handling, and a true daemon mode (Unix).
    
    *  Every feature now controllable on a per-site or per-location basis,
       configuration more powerful and versatile over-all.
