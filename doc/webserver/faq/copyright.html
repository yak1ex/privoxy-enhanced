      <p>A long time ago, there was the <a href=
      "http://www.junkbusters.com/ijb.html" target="_top"><span class=
      "APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span></a>, by Anonymous Coders and
      <a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/" target="_top">Junkbusters
      Corporation</a>. This saved many users a lot of pain in the early days
      of web advertising and user tracking.</p>

      <p>But the web, its protocols and standards, and with it, the
      techniques for forcing ads on users, give up autonomy over their
      browsing, and for tracking them, keeps evolving. Unfortunately, the
      <span class="APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span> did not. Version
      2.0.2, published in 1998, was (and is) the last official <a href=
      "http://www.junkbusters.com/ijbdist.html#release" target=
      "_top">release</a> available from <a href="http://www.junkbusters.com"
      target="_top">Junkbusters Corporation</a>. Fortunately, it had been
      released under the GNU <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target=
      "_top">GPL</a>, which allowed further development by others.</p>

      <p>So Stefan Waldherr started maintaining an improved version of the
      software, to which eventually a number of people contributed patches.
      It could already replace banners with a transparent image, and had a
      first version of pop-up killing, but it was still very closely based on
      the original, with all its limitations, such as the lack of HTTP/1.1
      support, flexible per-site configuration, or content modification. The
      last release from this effort was version 2.0.2-10, published in
      2000.</p>

      <p>Then, some <a href=
      "http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/copyright.html#AUTHORS" target=
      "_top">developers</a> picked up the thread, and started turning the
      software inside out, upside down, and then reassembled it, adding many
      <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/introduction.html#FEATURES"
      target="_top">new features</a> along the way.</p>

      <p>The result of this is <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>,
      whose first stable version, 3.0, was released August, 2002.</p>
