 should be virtually all browsers, including
 <SPAN

>Internet
 Explorer</SPAN

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Opera</SPAN

 <SPAN

 Direct browser support is not an absolute requirement since
 <SPAN

 to the browser in the standardized HTTP protocol, just like a web server
 does.</P

 Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista), GNU/Linux (RedHat, SuSE, Debian,
 Fedora, Gentoo, Slackware and others), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD,
 NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and various other flavors of Unix.</P

special I have to do now?</A
></H3
><P
> All browsers should be told to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 
 as a proxy by specifying the correct proxy address and port number 
 in the appropriate configuration area for the browser. It's possible
 to combine <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> with a packet filter to intercept HTTP requests
 even if the client isn't explicitly configured to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>,
 but where possible, configuring the client is recommended. See 
 <A
HREF="../user-manual/startup.html"
TARGET="_top"
>the User Manual for more
 details</A
>. You should also flush your browser's memory and disk
 cache to get rid of any cached junk items, and remove any stored

>2.5. What is the proxy address of Privoxy?</A
></H3
><P
>  If you set up the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to run on
  the computer you browse from (rather than your ISP's server or some
  networked computer on a LAN), the proxy will be on <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>127.0.0.1</TT
> 
  (sometimes referred to as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"localhost"</SPAN
>,
  which is the special name used by every computer on the Internet to refer
  to itself) and the port will be 8118 (unless you used the <A
HREF="../user-manual/config.html#LISTEN-ADDRESS"
TARGET="_top"
>listen-address</A
>
  config option to tell <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to run on
  a different port).
 </P
><P
>  When configuring your browser's proxy settings you typically enter
  the word <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"localhost"</SPAN
> or the IP address <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"127.0.0.1"</SPAN
>
  in the boxes next to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"HTTP"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Secure"</SPAN
> (HTTPS) and
  then the number <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"8118"</SPAN
> for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"port"</SPAN
>. 
  This tells your browser to send all web requests to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
  instead of directly to the Internet.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can also be used to proxy for 
  a Local Area Network. In this case, your would enter either the IP 
  address of the LAN host where <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 
  is running, or the equivalent hostname, e.g. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.1.1</TT
>.
  Port assignment would be same as above. Note that
  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> doesn't listen on any LAN interfaces by
  default.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> does not currently handle
  any other protocols such as FTP, SMTP, IM, IRC, ICQ, etc.

All the ads are there. What's wrong?</A
></H3
><P
> Did you configure your browser to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 
 as a proxy? It does not sound like it. See above. You might also try flushing
 the browser's caches to force a full re-reading of pages. You can verify 
 that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is running, and your browser 
 is correctly configured by entering the special URL: 
 <A
HREF="http://p.p/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://p.p/</A
>. 
 
 This should take you to a page titled <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"This is Privoxy.."</SPAN
> with
 access to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> internal configuration.
 If you see this, then you are good to go. If you receive a page saying 
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Privoxy is not running"</SPAN
>, then the browser is not set up to use
 your <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> installation.
 If you receive anything else (probably nothing at all), it could either
 be that the browser is not set up correctly, or that
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is not running at all. Check the <A
HREF="../user-manual/config.html#LOGFILE"
TARGET="_top"
>log file</A
>. For instructions
 on starting <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> and browser configuration,
 see the <A

 the dummy page, your browser has cached a redirection it encountered before
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> was being used. You need to clear your
 browser's cache. Note that shift-reloading the dummy page won't help, since
 that'll only refresh the dummy page, not the redirection that lead you there.</P
><P
> The procedure for clearing the cache varies from browser to browser. For
 example, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Mozilla/Netscape</SPAN
> users would click 
 <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Edit</SPAN
> --&#62; <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Preferences</SPAN
> --&#62;
 <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Advanced</SPAN
> --&#62; <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Cache</SPAN
> and
 then click both <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Clear Memory Cache</SPAN
>"</SPAN
>
 and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Clear Disk Cache</SPAN
>"</SPAN
>.
 In some <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Firefox</SPAN
> versions it's

CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Options</SPAN

 <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"

CLASS="GUIBUTTON"

> and
 then click <SPAN
