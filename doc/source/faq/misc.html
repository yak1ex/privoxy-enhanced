has to add extra time to browsing.</A
></H3
><P
> How much of an impact depends on many things, including the CPU of the host
 system, how aggressive the configuration is, which specific actions are being triggered, 
 the size of the page, the bandwidth of the connection, etc.</P
><P
> Overall, it should not slow you down any in real terms, and may actually help 
 speed things up since ads, banners and other junk are not typically being
 retrieved and displayed. The actual processing time required by
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> itself for each page, is relatively small
 in the overall scheme of things, and happens very quickly. This is typically
 more than offset by time saved not downloading and rendering ad images and
 other junk content (if ad blocking is being used).</P

CLASS="LITERAL"
><A
HREF="../user-manual/actions-file.html#DEANIMATE-GIFS"
TARGET="_top"
>deanimate-gifs</A
></TT
>
 actions may cause a perceived slowdown, since the entire document
 needs to be buffered before displaying. And on very large documents,
 filtering may have some measurable impact. How much depends on the page size,
 the actual definition of the filter(s), etc. See below. Most other actions
 have little to no impact on speed.</P
><P
> Also, when filtering is enabled but zlib support isn't available, compression
 is often disabled (see <A
HREF="../user-manual/actions-file.html#PREVENT-COMPRESSION"
TARGET="_top"
>prevent-compression</A
>).
 This can have an impact on speed as well, although it's probably smaller than
 you might think. Again, the page size, etc. will determine how much of an impact.</P

>
 action, the entire document must be loaded into memory in order for the filtering 
 mechanism to work, and nothing is sent to the browser during this time.</P
><P
> The loading time typically does not really change much in real numbers, but
 the feeling is different, because most browsers are able to start rendering
 incomplete content, giving the user a feeling of "it works". This effect is
 more noticeable on slower dialup connections. Extremely large documents
 may have some impact on the time to load the page where there is filtering
 being done. But overall, the difference should be very minimal. If there is a
 big impact, then probably some other situation is contributing (like
 anti-virus software).
 </P
><P
> Filtering is automatically disabled for inappropriate MIME types. But note 
 that if the web server mis-reports the MIME type, then content that should
 not be filtered, could be. <SPAN

 to differentiate filterable content because of the MIME type as reported by
 the server, or because of some configuration setting that enables/disables

 provide a further level of indirection between you and the web server.</P

> However, these proxies are called "anonymous" because you don't need
 to authenticate, not because they would offer any real anonymity.
 Most of them will log your IP address and make it available to the
 authorities in case you violate the law of the country they run in. In fact
 you can't even rule out that some of them only exist to *collect* information
 on (those suspicious) people with a more than average preference for privacy.</P
><P

 you should consider chaining <SPAN

 or a similar proxy and know what you're doing when it comes to configuring
 the rest of your system, you should assume that everything you do
 on the Web can be traced back to you.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 and allows <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

></SPAN
> more freedom to decide which sites 
 you can trust, and what details you want to reveal. But it neither 
 hides your IP address, nor can it guarantee that the rest of the system
 behaves correctly. There are several possibilities how a web sites can find
 out who you are, even if you are using a strict <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 configuration and chained it with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tor</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> Most of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> privacy-enhancing features can be easily subverted
 by an insecure browser configuration, therefore you should use a browser that can
 be configured to only execute code from trusted sites, and be careful which sites you trust.
 For example there is no point in having <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 modify the User-Agent header, if websites can get all the information they want
 through JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash, Java etc.</P
><P
> A few browsers disclose the user's email address in certain situations, such
 as when transferring a file by FTP. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 does not filter FTP. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
 mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you might
 consider products such as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>NSClean</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> Browsers available only as binaries could use non-standard headers to give
 out any information they can have access to: see the manufacturer's license
 agreement. It's impossible to anticipate and prevent every breach of privacy
 that might occur. The professionally paranoid prefer browsers available as
 source code, because anticipating their behavior is easier. Trust the source,

>4.11. Might some things break because header information or
content is being altered?</A
></H3
><P
> Definitely. It is common for sites to use browser type, browser version, 
 HTTP header content, and various other techniques in order to dynamically
 decide what to display and how to display it. What you see, and what I see,
 might be very different. There are many, many ways that this can be handled,
 so having hard and fast rules, is tricky.</P
><P
> The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 the browser, and adjust content accordingly.</P
><P
> Also, different browsers use different encodings of non-English
 characters, certain web servers convert pages on-the-fly according to the
 User Agent header. Giving a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"User Agent"</SPAN
> with the wrong
 operating system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in these languages
 to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites should change it to
 something closer. And then some page access counters work by looking at the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

> header; they may fail or break if unavailable. The
 weather maps of Intellicast have been blocked by their server when no
 <SPAN

 can forge both headers without giving information away). There are
 many other ways things can go wrong when trying to fool a web server. The
 results of which could inadvertently cause pages to load incorrectly,
 partially, or even not at all. And there may be no obvious clues as to just
 what went wrong, or why. Nowhere will there be a message that says

 cases, where the screen space is reserved (e.g. by HTML tables for instance).
 Also, making ads and banners disappear without any trace complicates
 troubleshooting, and would sooner or later be problematic.</P

 there is little that <SPAN

 If that name matches a host-only pattern, the connection will be blocked.</P
><P
> As far as ad blocking is concerned, this is less of a restriction than it may
 seem, since ad sources are often identifiable by the host name, and often
 the banners to be placed in an encrypted page come unencrypted nonetheless

CLASS="APPLICATION"

 be opened up to allow for LAN requests. In this case, we'd recommend
 you specify only the LAN gateway address, e.g. 192.168.1.1, in the main 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> configuration file and check all <A
HREF="../user-manual/config.html#ACCESS-CONTROL"

 options</A
>. All LAN hosts can then use this as their proxy address
 in the browser proxy configuration, but <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 will not listen on any external interfaces. ACLs can be defined in addition,
 and using a firewall is always good too. Better safe than sorry.</P

><P
> Filtering is potentially more of a concern since the results are not always
 so obvious, and the effects of filtering are there whether the file is simply
 viewed, or downloaded. And potentially whether the content is some obnoxious
 advertisement, or Mr. Jimmy's latest/greatest source code jewel. Of course,
 one of these presumably is <SPAN

 the other is <SPAN

 reported accurately (e.g. <SPAN

 then <SPAN

 appropriate. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 as well as plain text documents, subject to configuration parameters of
 course. Also, documents that are of an unknown type (generally assumed to be
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"text/plain"</SPAN
>) can be filtered, as will those that might be
 incorrectly reported by the webserver. If such a file is a downloaded file
 that is intended to be saved to disk, then any content that might have been
 altered by filtering, will be saved too, for these (probably rare) cases.</P

 <SPAN

 did filter this document type.</P

 by the webserver is appropriate <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I

> If you download text files, you probably do not want these to be filtered,
 particularly if the content is source code, or other critical content. Source
 code sometimes might be mistaken for Javascript (i.e. the kind that might
 open a pop-up window). It is recommended to turn off filtering for download
 sites (particularly if the content may be plain text files and you are using
 version 3.0.2 or earlier) in your <TT

 also, for any site or page where making <SPAN
