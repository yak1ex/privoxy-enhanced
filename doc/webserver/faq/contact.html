><P
> Please don't sent private support requests to individual Privoxy
 developers, either use the mailing lists or the support trackers.</P
><P
> Note that the Privoxy mailing lists are moderated. Posts from unsubscribed
 addresses have to be accepted manually by a moderator. This may cause a
 delay of several days and if you use a subject that doesn't clearly
 mention Privoxy or one of its features, your message may be accidentally
 discarded as spam.</P
><P
> If you aren't subscribed, you should therefore spend a few seconds
 to come up with a proper subject. Additionally you should make it clear
 that you want to get CC'd. Otherwise some responses will be directed to
 the mailing list only, and you won't see them.</P
