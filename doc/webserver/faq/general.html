CLASS="APPLICATION"

 </P

>  One of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN

  strengths is that it is highly configurable giving you the ability to
  completely personalize your installation. Being familiar with, or at least
  having an interest in learning about <A

>HTTP</A
> and other networking
  protocols, <A

><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

>
  will be a big plus and will help you get the most out of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>. 
  A new installation just includes a very basic configuration. The user 
  should take this as a starting point only, and enhance it as he or she 
  sees fit. In fact, the user is encouraged, and expected to, fine-tune the 
  configuration.
 </P

>Privoxy's</SPAN
> configuration can be done 
  with a <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"

>.
  But there are areas where configuration is done using a 
  <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editors"
TARGET="_top"
>text editor</A
>
  to edit configuration files. Also note that the web-based action editor
  doesn't use authentication and should only be enabled in environments
  where all clients with access to <SPAN

></H3
><P
>  A <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server"
TARGET="_top"
>web proxy</A
>
  is a service, based on a software such as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, that clients
  (i.e. browsers) can use instead of connecting to web servers directly.
  The clients then ask the proxy to request objects (web pages, images, movies etc)
  on their behalf and to forward the data to the clients.
  It is a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"go-between"</SPAN
>. For details, see
  <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server"
TARGET="_top"
>Wikipedia's proxy definition</A

 </P
><P

  efficiency (caching) and others, and there are any number of proxies
  to accommodate those needs.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is a proxy that is primarily focused on
  privacy enhancement, ad and junk elimination and freeing the user from
  restrictions placed on his activities. Sitting between your browser(s) and the Internet,
  it is in a perfect position to filter outbound personal information that your
  browser is leaking, as well as inbound junk. It uses a variety of techniques to do
  this, all of which are under your complete control via the various configuration
  files and options. Being a proxy also makes it easier to share
  configurations among multiple browsers and/or users.

 by Anonymous Coders and <A

TARGET="_top"
>Junkbusters
 Corporation</A
>. This saved many users a lot of pain in the early days of
 web advertising and user tracking.</P
><P
> But the web, its protocols and standards, and with it, the techniques for
 forcing  ads on users, give up autonomy over their browsing, and
 for tracking them, keeps evolving. Unfortunately, the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 (and is) the last official

 available from <A
HREF="http://www.junkbusters.com"

 Fortunately, it had been released under the GNU
 <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"
TARGET="_top"

 development by others.</P
><P
> So Stefan Waldherr started maintaining an
 <A

TARGET="_top"
>improved version of the
 software</A
>, to which eventually a number of people contributed patches.
 It could already replace banners with a transparent image, and had a first
 version of pop-up killing, but it was still very closely based on the
 original, with all its limitations, such as the lack of HTTP/1.1 support,
 flexible per-site configuration, or content modification. The last release
 from this effort was version 2.0.2-10, published in 2000.</P
><P
> Then, some
 <A
HREF="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/copyright.html#AUTHORS"
TARGET="_top"
>developers</A
>
 picked up the thread, and started turning the software inside out, upside down,
 and then reassembled it, adding many
 <A
HREF="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/introduction.html#FEATURES"
TARGET="_top"
>new
 features</A
> along the way.</P
><P

>1.8. How does Privoxy know what is
an ad, and what is not?</A
></H3
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>'s approach to blocking ads is twofold:</P
><P
> First, there are certain patterns in the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>locations</I
></SPAN
> (URLs)
 of banner images. This applies to both the path (you wouldn't guess how many
 web sites serve their banners from a directory called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"banners"</SPAN
>!)
 and the host (blocking the big banner hosting services like doublecklick.net
 already helps a lot). <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> takes advantage of this
 fact by using <A
HREF="../user-manual/actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS"
TARGET="_top"
>URL
 patterns</A
> to sort out and block the requests for things that sound 
 like they would be ads or banners.</P
><P
> Second, banners tend to come in certain <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>sizes</I
></SPAN
>. But you
 can't tell the size of an image by its URL without downloading it, and if you
 do, it's too late to save bandwidth. Therefore, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 also inspects the HTML sources of web pages while they are loaded, and replaces
 references to images with standard banner sizes by dummy references, so that
 your browser doesn't request them anymore in the first place.</P
><P
> Both of this involves a certain amount of guesswork and is, of course, freely
 and readily configurable.</P

NAME="AEN157"

This does not sound very scientific.</A
></H3
><P
> Actually, it's a black art ;-) And yes, it is always possible to have a broad
 rule accidentally block or change something by mistake. You will almost surely
 run into such situations at some point. It is tricky writing rules to
 cover every conceivable possibility, and not occasionally get false positives.</P
><P
> But this should not be a big concern since the
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> configuration is very flexible, and
 includes tools to help identify these types of situations so they can be
 addressed as needed, allowing you to customize your installation.

 The default installation should give you a good starting
 point, and block <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="EMPHASIS"

></SPAN

 but many of the more advanced features are off by default, and require
 you to activate them. </P

 <SPAN

 or ads not being blocked that you may not want to see. In these cases, you
 would certainly benefit by customizing <SPAN
