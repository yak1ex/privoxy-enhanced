<para>
 The binaries provided by members of the Privoxy team have the following
 testing platforms, earliest supported OS versions and processor architectures.
 Be aware that down-level versions of Privoxy contain known security issues.
 <emphasis>It is preferable to build the latest code to target earlier OS releases
 than use an earlier Privoxy release</emphasis>:

<para>
 Any operating system that runs TCP/IP, can conceivably take advantage of
 <application>Privoxy</application> in a networked situation where
 <application>Privoxy</application> would run as a server on a LAN gateway.
 Then only the <quote>gateway</quote> needs to be running one of the above
 operating systems.
</para>

<para>
 Source code is freely available, so porting to other operating systems
 is always a possibility, as is compiling for older versions of supported
 operating systems.
