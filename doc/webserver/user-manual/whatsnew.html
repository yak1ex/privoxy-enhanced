    Release</a></h1>

    <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy 3.0.21</span> stable is a bug-fix
    release for Privoxy 3.0.20 beta. It also addresses two security issues
    that affect all previous Privoxy versions. The changes since 3.0.20 beta
    are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Bug fixes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>On POSIX-like platforms, network sockets with file descriptor
            values above FD_SETSIZE are properly rejected. Previously they
            could cause memory corruption in configurations that allowed the
            limit to be reached.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Proxy authentication headers are removed unless the new
            directive enable-proxy-authentication-forwarding is used.
            Forwarding the headers potentionally allows malicious sites to
            trick the user into providing them with login information. Reported
            by Chris John Riley.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Compiles on OS/2 again now that unistd.h is only included on
            platforms that have it.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>General improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The show-status page shows the FEATURE_STRPTIME_SANITY_CHECKS
            status.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>A couple of assert()s that could theoretically dereference
            NULL pointers in debug builds have been relocated.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Added an LSB info block to the generic start script. Based on
            a patch from Natxo Asenjo.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The max-client-connections default has been changed to 128
            which should be more than enough for most setups.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Action file improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Block rover.ebay./ar.*\&amp;adtype= instead of
            "/.*\&amp;adtype=" which caused too man false positives. Reported
            by u302320 in #360284, additional feedback from Adam Piggott.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Unblock '.advrider.com/' and '/.*ADVrider'. Anonymously
            reported in #3603636.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Stop blocking '/js/slider\.js'. Reported by Adam Piggott in
            #3606635 and _lvm in #2791160.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Filter file improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Added an iframes filter.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Documentation improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The whole GPLv2 text is included in the user manual now, so
            Privoxy can serve it itself and the user can read it without
            having to wade through GPLv3 ads first.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Properly numbered and underlined a couple of section titles in
            the config that where previously overlooked due to a flaw in the
            conversion script. Reported by Ralf Jungblut.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Improved the support instruction to hopefully make it harder
            to unintentionally provide insufficient information when
            requesting support. Previously it wasn't obvious that the
            information we need in bug reports is usually also required in
            support requests.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Removed documentation about packages that haven't been
            provided in years.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Privoxy-Regression-Test:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Only log the test number when not running in verbose mode The
            position of the test is rarely relevant and it previously wasn't
            exactly obvious which one of the numbers was useful to repeat the
            test with --test-number.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>GNUmakefile improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Factor generate-config-file out of config-file to make testing
            more convenient.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The clean target now also takes care of patch leftovers.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy 3.0.20</span> beta contained the
    following changes compared to the previous stable release:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Bug fixes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Client sockets are now properly shutdown and drained before
            being closed. This fixes page truncation issues with clients that
            aggressively pipeline data on platforms that otherwise discard
            already written data. The issue mainly affected Opera users and
            was initially reported by Kevin in #3464439, szotsaki provided
            additional information to track down the cause.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix latency calculation for shared connections (disabled by
            default). It was broken since their introduction in 2009. The
            calculated latency for most connections would be 0 in which case
            the timeout detection failed to account for the real latency.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Reject URLs with invalid port. Previously they were parsed
            incorrectly and characters between the port number and the first
            slash were silently dropped as shown by curl test 187.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The default-server-timeout and socket-timeout directives
            accept 0 as valid value.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix a race condition on Windows that could cause Privoxy to
            become unresponsive after toggling it on or off through the
            taskbar icon. Reported by Tim H. in #3525694.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix the compilation on Windows when configured without IPv6
            support.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix an assertion that could cause debug builds to abort() in
            case of socks5 connection failures with "debug 2" enabled.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix an assertion that could cause debug builds to abort() if a
            filter contained nul bytes in the replacement text.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>General improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Significantly improved keep-alive support for both client and
            server connections.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>New debug log level 65536 which logs all actions that were
            applied to the request.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>New directive client-header-order to forward client headers in
            a different order than the one in which they arrived.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>New directive tolerate-pipelining to allow client-side
            pipelining. If enabled (3.0.20 beta enables it by default),
            Privoxy will keep pipelined client requests around to deal with
            them once the current request has been served.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>New --config-test option to let Privoxy exit after checking
            whether or not the configuration seems valid. The limitations
            noted in TODO #22 and #23 still apply. Based on a patch by
            Ramkumar Chinchani.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>New limit-cookie-lifetime{} action to let cookies expire
            before the end of the session. Suggested by Rick Sykes in
            #1049575.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Increase the hard-coded maximum number of actions and filter
            files from 10 to 30 (each). It doesn't significantly affect
            Privoxy's memory usage and recompiling wasn't an option for all
            Privoxy users that reached the limit.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add support for chunk-encoded client request bodies.
            Previously chunk-encoded request bodies weren't guaranteed to be
            forwarded correctly, so this can also be considered a bug fix
            although chunk-encoded request bodies aren't commonly used in the
            real world.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add support for Tor's optimistic-data SOCKS extension, which
            can reduce the latency for requests on newly created connections.
            Currently only the headers are sent optimistically and only if
            the client request has already been read completely which rules
            out requests with large bodies.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>After preventing the client from pipelining, don't signal
            keep-alive intentions. When looking at the response headers
            alone, it previously wasn't obvious from the client's perspective
            that no additional responses should be expected.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Stop considering client sockets tainted after receiving a
            request with body. It hasn't been necessary for a while now and
            unnecessarily causes test failures when using curl's test
            suite.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Allow HTTP/1.0 clients to signal interest in keep-alive
            through the Proxy-Connection header. While such client are rare
            in the real world, it doesn't hurt and couple of curl tests rely
            on it.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Only remove duplicated Content-Type headers when filters are
            enabled. If they are not it doesn't cause ill effects and the
            user might not want it. Downgrade the removal message to
            LOG_LEVEL_HEADER to clarify that it's not an error in Privoxy and
            is unlikely to cause any problems in general. Anonymously
            reported in #3599335.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Set the socket option SO_LINGER for the client socket.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Move several variable declarations to the beginning of their
            code block. It's required when compiling with gcc 2.95 which is
            still used on some platforms. Initial patch submitted by Simon
            South in #3564815.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Optionally try to sanity-check strptime() results before
            trusting them. Broken strptime() implementations have caused
            problems in the past and the most recent offender seems to be
            FreeBSD's libc (standards/173421).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When filtering is enabled, let Range headers pass if the range
            starts at the beginning. This should work around (or at least
            reduce) the video playback issues with various Apple clients as
            reported by Duc in #3426305.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Do not confuse a client hanging up with a connection time out.
            If a client closes its side of the connection without sending a
            request line, do not send the CLIENT_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_RESPONSE,
            but report the condition properly.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Allow closing curly braces as part of action values as long as
            they are escaped.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>On Windows, the logfile is now written before showing the GUI
            error message which blocks until the user acknowledges it.
            Reported by Adriaan in #3593603.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove an unreasonable parameter limit in the CGI interface.
            The new parameter limit depends on the memory available and is
            currently unlikely to be reachable, due to other limits in both
            Privoxy and common clients. Reported by Andrew on
            ijbswa-users@.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Decrease the chances of parse failures after requests with
            unsupported methods were sent to the CGI interface.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Action file improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Remove the comment that indicated that updated default.action
            versions are released on their own.</p>
          </li>

            <p>Block 'optimize.indieclick.com/' and

      <li>
        <p>Documentation improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Revised all OS X sections due to new packaging module
            (OSXPackageBuilder).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Update the list of supported operating systems to clarify that
            all Windows versions after 95 are expected to work and note that
            the platform-specific code for AmigaOS and QNX currently isn't
            maintained.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Update 'Signals' section, the only explicitly handled signals
            are SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add Haiku to the list of operating systems on which Privoxy is
            known to run.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add DragonFly to the list of BSDs on which Privoxy is known to
            run.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Removed references to redhat-specific documentation set since
            it no longer exists.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Removed references to building PDFs since we no longer do
            so.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Multiple listen-address directives are supported since 3.0.18,
            correct the documentation to say so.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove bogus section about long and short being preferable to

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Corrected some Internet JunkBuster references to Privoxy.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Removed references to www.junkbusters.com since it is no

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Various grammar and spelling corrections</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add a client-header-tagger{} example for disabling filtering
            for range requests.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Correct a URL in the "Privoxy with Tor" FAQ.</p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove an incorrect sentence in the toggle section. The toggle
            state doesn't affect whether or not the Windows version uses the
            tray icon. Reported by Zeno Kugy in #3596395.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add new contributors since 3.0.19.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Log message improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>When stopping to watch a client socket due to pipelining,
            additionally log the socket number.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Log the client socket and its condition before closing it.
            This makes it more obvious that the socket actually gets closed
            and should help when diagnosing problems like #3464439.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>In case of SOCKS5 failures, do not explicitly log the server's
            response. It hasn't helped so far and the response can already be
            logged by enabling "debug 32768" anyway. This reverts v1.81 and
            the follow-up bug fix v1.84.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Relocate the connection-accepted message from listen_loop() to
            serve(). This way it's printed by the thread that is actually
            serving the connection which is nice when grepping for thread ids
            in log files.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Code cleanups:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Remove compatibility layer for versions prior to 3.0 since it
            has been obsolete for more than 10 years now.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove the ijb_isupper() and ijb_tolower() macros from
            parsers.c since they aren't used in this file.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Removed the 'Functions declared include:' comment sections
            since they tend to be incomplete, incorrect and out of date and
            the benefit seems questionable.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Various comment grammar and comprehensibility
            improvements.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove a pointless fflush() call in chat(). Flushing all
            streams pretty much all the time for no obvious reason is
            ridiculous.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Relocate ijb_isupper()'s definition to project.h and get the
            ijb_tolower() definition from there, too.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Relocate ijb_isdigit()'s definition to project.h.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Rename ijb_foo macros to privoxy_foo.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add malloc_or_die() which will allow to simplify code paths
            where malloc() failures don't need to be handled gracefully.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add strdup_or_die() which will allow to simplify code paths
            where strdup() failures don't need to be handled gracefully.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Replace strdup() calls with strdup_or_die() calls where it's
            safe and simplifies the code.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix white-space around parentheses.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add missing white-space behind if's and the following
            parentheses.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Unwrap a memcpy() call in resolve_hostname_to_ip().</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Declare pcrs_get_delimiter()'s delimiters[] static const.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Various optimisations to remove dead code and merge
            inefficient code structures for improved clarity, performance or
            code compactness.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Various data type corrections.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Change visibility of several code segments when compiling
            without FEATURE_CONNECTION_KEEP_ALIVE enabled for clarity.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>In pcrs_get_delimiter(), do not use delimiters outside the
            ASCII range. Fixes a clang complaint.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix an error message in get_last_url() nobody is supposed to
            see. Reported by Matthew Fischer in #3507301.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fix a typo in the no-zlib-support complaint. Patch submitted
            by Matthew Fischer in #3507304.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Shorten ssplit()'s prototype by removing the last two
            arguments. We always want to skip empty fields and ignore leading
            delimiters, so having parameters for this only complicates the
            API.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use an enum for the type of the action value.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Rename action_name's member takes_value to value_type as it
            isn't used as boolean.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Turn family mismatches in match_sockaddr() into fatal
            errors.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let enlist_unique_header() verify that the caller didn't pass
            a header containing either \r or \n.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Change the hashes used in load_config() to unsigned int.
            That's what hash_string() actually returns and using a
            potentially larger type is at best useless.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use privoxy_tolower() instead of vanilla tolower() with manual
            casting of the argument.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Catch ssplit() failures in parse_cgi_parameters().</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Privoxy-Regression-Test:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Add an 'Overwrite condition' directive to skip any matching
            tests before it. As it has a global scope, using it is more
            convenient than clowning around with the Ignore directive.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Log to STDOUT instead of STDERR.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Include the Privoxy version in the output.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Various grammar and spelling corrections in documentation and
            code.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Additional tests for range requests with filtering
            enabled.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Tests with mostly invalid range request.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add a couple of hide-if-modified-since{} tests with different
            date formats.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Cleaned up the format of the regression-tests.action file to
            match the format of default.action.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove the "Copyright" line from print_version(). When using
            --help, every line of screen space matters and thus shouldn't be
            wasted on things the user doesn't care about.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Privoxy-Log-Parser:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Improve the --statistics performance by skipping sanity checks
            for input that shouldn't affect the results anyway. Add a
            --strict-checks option that enables some of the checks again,
            just in case anybody cares.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The distribution of client requests per connection is included
            in the --statistic output.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The --accept-unknown-messages option has been removed and the
            behavior is now the default.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Accept and (mostly) highlight new log messages introduced with
            Privoxy 3.0.20.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>uagen:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Bump generated Firefox version to 17.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>GNUmakefile improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The dok-tidy target no longer taints documents with a
            tidy-mark</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Change RA_MODE from 0664 to 0644. Suggested by Markus Dittrich
            in #3505445.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove tidy's clean flag as it changes the scope of
            attributes. Link-specific colors end up being applied to all
            text. Reported by Adam Piggott in #3569551.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Leave it up to the user whether or not smart tags are
            inserted.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let w3m itself do the line wrapping for the config file. It
            works better than fmt as it can honour pre tags causing less
            unintentional line breaks.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Ditch a pointless '-r' passed to rm to delete files.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The config-file target now requires less manual intervention
            and updates the original config.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Change WDUMP to generate ASCII. Add WDUMP_UTF8 to allow UTF-8
            in the AUTHORS file so the names are right.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Stop pretending that lynx and links are supported for the
            documentation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>configure improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>On Haiku, do not pass -lpthread to the compiler. Haiku's
            pthreads implementation is contained in its system library,
            libroot, so no additional library needs to be searched. Patch
            submitted by Simon South in #3564815.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Additional Haiku-specific improvements. Disable checks
            intended for multi-user systems as Haiku is presently
            single-user. Group Haiku-specific settings in their own section,
            following the pattern for Solaris, OS/2 and AmigaOS. Add
            additional library-related settings to remove the need for
            providing configure with custom LDFLAGS. Submitted by Simon South
            in #3574538.</p>

      <p>A quick list of things to be aware of before upgrading from earlier
      versions of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The recommended way to upgrade <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is to backup your old configuration
          files, install the new ones, verify that <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is working correctly and finally merge
          back your changes using <span class="APPLICATION">diff</span> and
          maybe <span class="APPLICATION">patch</span>.</p>

          <p>There are a number of new features in each <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> release and most of them have to be
          explicitly enabled in the configuration files. Old configuration
          files obviously don't do that and due to syntax changes using old
          configuration files with a new <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> isn't always possible anyway.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Note that some installers remove earlier versions completely,
          including configuration files, therefore you should really save any
          important configuration files!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>On the other hand, other installers don't overwrite existing
          configuration files, thinking you will want to do that
          yourself.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>In the default configuration only fatal errors are logged now.
          You can change that in the <a href="config.html#DEBUG">debug
          section</a> of the configuration file. You may also want to enable
          more verbose logging until you verified that the new <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version is working as expected.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Three other config file settings are now off by default:
          <a href="config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE">enable-remote-toggle</a>,
          <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-HTTP-TOGGLE">enable-remote-http-toggle</a>,
          and <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS">enable-edit-actions</a>. If you
          use or want these, you will need to explicitly enable them, and be
          aware of the security issues involved.</p>
