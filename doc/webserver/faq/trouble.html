  to either fight the ZA configuration, or uninstall ZoneAlarm, and then find

still getting through. How?</A
></H3
><P
> If the ad had been displayed before you added its URL, it will probably be
 held in the browser's cache for some time, so it will be displayed without
 the need for any request to the server, and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 will not be involved. Flush the browser's caches, and then try again.</P
><P
> If this doesn't help, you probably have an error in the rule you
 applied. Try pasting the full URL of the offending ad into <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</A
>
 and see if it really matches your new rule. Blocking ads is like blocking
 spam: a lot of tinkering is required to stay ahead of the game. And 
 remember you need to block the URL of the ad in question, which may be 
 entirely different from the site URL itself. Most ads are hosted on different
 servers than the main site itself. If you right-click on the ad, you should
 be able to get all the relevant information you need. Alternately, you can 
 find the correct URL by looking at <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> logs
 (you may need to enable logging in the main config file if its disabled).</P
><P
> Below is a slightly modified real-life log snippet that originates with one 
 requested URL: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>www.example.com</TT
> (name of site was changed
 for this example, the number of requests is real). You can see in this the
 complexity of what goes into making up this one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"page"</SPAN
>. There
 are eight different domains involved here, with thirty two separate URLs
 requested in all, making up all manner of images, Shockwave Flash,
 JavaScript, CSS stylesheets, scripts, and other related content. Some of this
 content is obviously <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"good"</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bad"</SPAN
>, but not all.
 Many of the more questionable looking requests, are going to outside domains
 that seem to be identifying themselves with suspicious looking names, making
 our job a little easier. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> has <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"crunched"</SPAN

 and BLOCKED) quite a few items in this example, but perhaps missed a few as well. </P

 by toggling off <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/toggle</A

 (the toggle feature may need to be enabled in the main
 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config</TT
>),
 and then shift-reloading the problem page (i.e. holding down the shift key
 while clicking reload. Alternatively, flush your browser's disk and memory
 caches).</P
><P
> If the problem went away, we know we have a configuration related problem.
 Now go to <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</A
>
 and paste the full URL of the page in question into the prompt. See which
 actions are being applied to the URL, and which matches in which actions
 files are responsible for that. It might be helpful also to look at your logs
 for this site too, to see what else might be happening (note: logging may need
 to be enabled in the main config file). Many sites are
 complex and require a number of related pages to help present their content.
 Look at what else might be used by the page in question, and what of that
 might be <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>required</I
></SPAN
>.
 Now, armed with this information, go to
 <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</A
>
 and select the appropriate actions files for editing. </P
><P
> You can now either look for a section which disables the actions that
 you suspect to cause the problem and add a pattern for your site there,
 or make up a completely new section for your site. In any case, the recommended
 way is to disable only the prime suspect, reload the problem page, and only
 if the problem persists, disable more and more actions until you have
 identified the culprit. You may or may not want to turn the other actions
 on again. Remember to flush your browser's caches in between any such changes!</P
><P
> Alternately, if you are comfortable with a text editor, you can accomplish 
 the same thing by editing the appropriate actions file. Probably the easiest 
 way to deal with such problems when editing by hand is to add your
 site to a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>{ fragile }</TT
> section in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>user.action</TT
>,
 which is an alias that turns off most <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dangerous"</SPAN
>
 actions, but is also likely to turn off more actions then needed, and thus lower
 your privacy and protection more than necessary, </P

NAME="DUN"
>5.5. After installing Privoxy, I have to log in
every time I start IE. What gives?</A
></H3
><P
> This is a quirk that effects the installation of
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, in conjunction with Internet Explorer and
 Internet Connection Sharing on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. The symptoms may
 appear to be corrupted or invalid DUN settings, or passwords.</P
><P
> When setting up an NT based Windows system with
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> you may find that things do not seem to be
 doing what you expect. When you set your system up you will probably have set
 up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) with Dial up Networking (DUN) when
 logged in with administrator privileges. You will probably have made this DUN
 connection available to other accounts that you may have set-up on your
 system. E.g. Mum or Dad sets up the system and makes accounts suitably
 configured for the kids.</P
><P
> When setting up <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> in this environment you
 will have to alter the proxy set-up of Internet Explorer (IE) for the
 specific DUN connection on which you wish to use
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>. When you do this the ICS DUN set-up
 becomes user specific. In this instance you will see no difference if you
 change the DUN connection under the account used to set-up the connection.
 However when you do this from another user you will notice that the DUN
 connection changes to make available to "Me only". You will also find that
 you have to store the password under each different user!</P
><P
> The reason for this is that each user's set-up for IE is user specific. Each
 set-up DUN connection and each LAN connection in IE store the settings for
 each user individually. As such this enforces individual configurations
 rather than common ones. Hence the first time you use a DUN connection after
 re-booting your system it may not perform as you expect, and prompt you for 
 the password. Just set and save the password again and all should be OK.</P

 </P
><P
>  Most browsers understand FTP as well as HTTP. If you connect to a site, with
  a URL like <TT

  such traffic.
 </P

 merely initiates the process and hands it off, and then later reports
 whatever the outcome was and tries to give a coherent message if there seems
 to be a problem. In some cases, this might otherwise be mitigated by the
 browser itself which might try some work-arounds and alternate approaches (e.g
 adding <SPAN

 delays and timeouts. In the case of a <SPAN

><P
> This is probably a manifestation of the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 occurs on pages containing many (thousands upon thousands) of blank lines. The blank lines 
 are in the raw HTML source of the page, and the browser just ignores them. But the 
 pattern matching in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> page filtering
 mechanism is trying to match against absurdly long strings and this becomes
 very CPU-intensive, taking a long, long time to complete.</P
